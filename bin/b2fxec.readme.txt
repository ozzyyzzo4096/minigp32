b2fxec v0.2e (c) 2002 Jouni 'Mr.Spiv' Korhonen

	*Note! Version 0.2e adds data save option.*
	*Note! Version 0.2d fixes a BMP loading problem.*
	*Note! Version 0.2e adds better compatability to Pacrom v0.31b.*

	b2fxec is a tool to create crunched (compressed) FXEs and GXBs
	from normal GXBs and AXFs. The usage of this tool is almost
	identical to famous b2fxe tool by Jeff F.
	
	The nice thing about b2fxec is that the outputted file also contains
	a short and fast decruncher (decompressor) program that can
	actually run the crunched file. So produced FXEs and GXBs are completely
	self contained. I find it functionally equivalent to UPX and all other exe
	packers.
	
	To find out program options type:
		b2fxec -h
		
	There are some limitations at the moment: the crunched data and the
	decrunched data must fit into GP32's memory at the same time! This
	will change in the future - hopefully. The b2fxec cannot crunch existing
	FXEs directly. If you want to crunch a FXE you must first unfxe it to
	a GXB and then crunch it. You should find the unfxe tool from the my
	web-pages.
